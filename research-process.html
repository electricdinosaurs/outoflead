                    <h2>research process</h2>
                    <p>
                        The following is a typical research process for me, using a poster I made for a policy study program as an example.
                    </p>

                        <h3>1. choosing a topic</h3>
                        <p>
                            This particular project was inspired by a talk I attended at the <a href="https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/">Learning Policy Institute</a>. <i>The Flat World and Education: How America's Commitment to Equity Will Determine Our Future</i> by Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond was extremely influential for me in college, so I wanted to view more of her line of work. I happened to attend a talk by Dr. Susan Loeb, who would become another influential figure for me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dr. Loeb spoke of her work at the <a href="https://annenberg.brown.edu/">Annenberg Institute</a> finding evidence-based tutoring practices. The focus of their work is on equitable education, one of my strongest academic interests. My own experience as a tutor pushed me to choose this as my research topic for the quarter; for my entire tutoring career, I'd been frustrated at how little pedagogical training I'd been given. I wanted a better way to ensure that students were getting the support they deserved. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The institute has published some data on tutoring organizations, recording certain elements of their practices and approach. I decided to analyze this data to determine what factors were associated with organizations' likelihood of fitting the criteria for tutoring best practices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project gave me virtually unlimited freedom. For other projects I've done in the past, I've started from seed papers given to me by my graduate student advisor and designed my own studies to test my resulting questions, or gathered information on a specific policy topic in order to write a two-page briefing for state officials.

                        <h3>2. literature review</h3>
                        <p>
                            Where I look depends on the project in question. For policy research, I use the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes.xhtml">California State Code</a> and the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/uscode">United States Code</a> to examine source text. For the present research, I used education and psychology databases, available through my university library. If I were conducting a systematic review, I would develop a pre-defined set of keywords and boolean conditions; for this project, I did not.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I organize my sources using <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>. I use the first-second-third read process to scan abstracts to see if they fit my purposes, skim the discussion to get an idea of the findings, and finally do a full read with annotations to record my questions and mark important evidence. For central sources, I'll write a summary of each section and store these notes in an annotated bibliography.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also decided to examine the California Education Code for mentions of tutoring. I found that the content of tutoring programs was not regulated, although my review was not exhaustive.

                            For maximal control over the visuals of my final product, I used Figma instead of a presentation-making application.
