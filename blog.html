                    <h2>"best of": classes that changed my life</h2>
                    <p>
                        Generally, the theme is this: the classes that almost made me cry (due to the content difficulty, not due to the class organization) became the most rewarding ones. Yes, there are topics in other classes that were useful and enjoyable to me, such as research design, the role of news outlets in promoting democracy, and education governance in China and Mexico, but the courses in this list stand out in my memory as causing a shift in the way I see the world.

                        <p>
                            This course was the first time in college where I sat down to take the midterm and thought I was going to have a panic attack. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I will always remember the moment I finally understood recursion.

                        <p>
                            I remember coming away from this class feeling that every high-school student should have to learn the content contained within, instead of whatever made us so hate health sciences as teenagers.

                        <p>
                            
                        </p>

                        <h3>5. Psych 119N: Visual systems</h3>
                        <p>
                            I only signed up for this course because it fit the requirements for graduation (I was in my last quarter at the time). I thought I was going to be bored to death by grainy slides of goldfish eyes. In fact, this only happened one time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What made this class stand out, like so many of the others on this list, was the assigned textbook. I don't know what the entire psychology department at my school is thinking, but they must have missed the memo somewhere: they teach as if every student is going to become a researcher. And while it pays to think like a researcher, even a researcher is not going to want to learn about their field by staring at other people's results. First, they will need a foundation, a conceptual framework for <i>what</i> it is we're looking for in the first place, and <i>why</i>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, surprisingly, the last quarter of my last year at college was where I first was given the chance to take a look at neuroscience as a philosophy: as a meditation on not only how the brain works, but what the brain itself is in the context of millions of years of evolution, and why computers are often good models of nervous systems, and what information theory and psychology and chemistry and physics and math has to do with it all. If my entire major had been built around this book, I could not have been happier.

                        <h3>6. Education 162: Introduction to educational policy</h3>
                        <p>
                            I'm not sure why I took this class. Sometimes you will look back on your life and misattribute certain turns that you took to the influence of a specific person or course, and for a long time I thought that my interest in education policy stemmed from this course. But I must have chosen to take this for a reason. I think that at that time I was trying to figure out what an alternate path in education could look like, if I wasn't to be a career-long teacher. In any case, the unusual guest-speaker format of this course, paired with the text <i>The Flat World and Education</i> by the incredible Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond, solidified policy as a major goal of the second half of my college career.

                        <h3>7. Chem 14D: Organic chemistry for life science majors</h3>
                        <p>
                            When I saw my first homework assignment, I called my best friend from high school, who happens to be very good at molecular biology. I could not figure out for the life of me what an electrophilic molecule was.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thankfully, my professor was one of the most supportive ones I've ever had, and he managed to make an online class feel like a community. His end-of-class speech moved me to tears: the only words I remember are "one day, I'll have to go to the hospital, and Dr. [a student's name] will be there taking care of me, and I'll be so proud knowing that I am in good care..."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although this was probably the single most unfamiliar and daunting field of study I've covered during my undergraduate years, the confidence I gained throughout the quarter felt immeasurably good. Solving each reaction came to feel like a brainteaser. Granted, I don't think I remember much of anything, but I'll try.

                        <p>
                            To be honest, this is kind of a bonus: this course didn't change my life as much as it was just plain <i>fun</i>. I really liked coming to class every day and solving the worksheets:)

                            I can't resist throwing in the self-learning tools that have changed my life for the better. Three of the most useful skills I have today (all of which are still very much in progress) are attributable to the tireless work of those who have made high-quality free online education a reality.
