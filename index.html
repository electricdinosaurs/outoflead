                    <p>
                        hi! I'm karen yi, and I love combining my interests in education, coding, and psychology. since that sounds pretty vague, my experiences have been concentrated mainly in education policy research and user experience design for the public good, as well as data science teaching. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm very influenced by the boundaries I've balanced in life: living in california and colorado, being chinese and american, working in stem and humanities. through the years, I've discovered that community is central to me, so I'm shaping my career around it.
                    </p>
