                    <p>
                        Hi! I'm Karen. I love combining my interests in education, policy, coding, and psychology. Since that sounds pretty vague, my experiences have been concentrated mainly in education policy research and user-experience design for public good, as well as data science teaching. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm deeply influenced by the boundaries I've balanced in life: living in California and Colorado, being Chinese and American, working in STEM and humanities. Through the years, I've discovered that community is central to me, so I'm shaping my career around community empowerment and social change. I'm really excited by problem solving and the prospect of learning new things&mdash;methods, theories, and ideas&mdash;about the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recently, my experiences in work and research and life have begun to converge on one guiding principle: cooperation. I believe that too much of today's research and activism is duplicative, ignores history and institutional knowledge, mistakenly believes that new is always better, and prevents successful collaboration by siloing and splintering. These are strong words, but the general conclusion I've drawn is to reach out whenever possible. These concepts have been variously termed "participatory action research", "design justice", and "collective impact" as they apply to various different fields. I'd love to work more towards this goal in the next phase of my life, as I graduate from college and gain the time to dedicate to full-time work.
                    </p>

                                    Taught psychological stats and research methods, two of my favorite topics to teach! Out of many teaching opportunities at UCLA, I chose this program for its emphasis on accessible, non-intimidating learning, while supporting student populations that have been historically overlooked. I consider many tutoring companies to be disorganized at best and predatory at worst, a topic I expand on in my project on high-impact tutoring below, so I choose the places I work with carefully.

                                    While here, I spearheaded a project to further improve how employees are trained. I conducted qualitative research in small groups of current employees on the challenges they faced in their positions and the strategies they adopted or invented.

I wrote briefings for the state superintendent of California himself!

                                    Here, I developed my skills in psychological research design and methods with the support of a great team of researchers from across the country, with whom I engaged in countless conversations about hierarchical linear regression, Likert analysis, GitHub, blocked designs, and everything else relating to educational psychology and statistics. Here, I conducted an independent project on <a href="#projects">improving computer-science education</a> for marginalized populations based on my graduate student advisor's work.

                                    This project gave me a chance to apply both qualitative and quantitative research methods, such as open-response coding and survival curve analysis. Future explorations could include sentiment analysis and other methods inspired by machine learning.

                                    So many skills that aren't directly identifiable are developed by taking on responsibility: not only for an organization, but also for the people you serve. In this role, I learned about a student organization's capacity and limitations for institutional change. I directed multiple teams, collected feedback, organized meetings and events, applied for funding, met with community organizations, and overall tried to create a democratic system while maintaining direction.

I joined this organization out of a need to contribute something beyond myself during the pandemic, but I could not have predicted the bond that I've formed with the student I was paired with, or the direct perspective on the holes in the American foster-care and education systems that I have gained. I am having a hard time putting into words the impact that this experience has made on me, personally and professionally.

                        Other than reading the New York Times every day (basic, I know), making really bad puns on Instagram, and going on hikes with my friends and family, I try to make time for the following:

                    <h3>languages</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you ask me, to learn a language is to slowly unlock parts of the world you never would have been able to experience otherwise. When choosing languages to learn, I am motivated by how commonly used they are, and also by whether they are spoken by my friends. It is a form of respect and deeper connection to understand the culture of the people around you.
