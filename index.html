                        taught psychological stats and research methods! this program was awesome because it emphasizes accessible, non-intimidating learning, while supporting student populations that have been historically overlooked. I've learned a lot from

                        I applied for a cross-campus policy program basically on a whim, and I was so lucky to be able to learn so much about california governance and policy as a psychobiology major. I wrote policy briefings for the state superintendent of california himself! and

                        I had the chance here to research the history and current climate around affirmative action and american indian studies (both very interesting stuff). shoutout to michelle for being the most supportive coworker I've ever had. let me tell you, before this experience I could not have told you the slightest thing about how an idea becomes law.

                        this was my very first research experience. shoutout to everyone here for being very kind and patient with me as I figured out the ropes of psychological research design and methods. I conducted an independent project on <a href="#projects">improving computer-science education</a> for marginalized populations based on my graduate student advisor's work. still haven't written up the full paper...but I'm working on it...
