                    <p>
                        Hi! I'm Karen Yi, and I love combining my interests in education, policy, coding, and psychology. Since that sounds pretty vague, my experiences have been concentrated mainly in education policy research and user-experience design for public good, as well as data science teaching. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm very influenced by the boundaries I've balanced in life: living in California and Colorado, being Chinese and American, working in STEM and humanities. Through the years, I've discovered that community is central to me, so I'm shaping my career around community empowerment and social change.
                    </p>

                        Most people are principally aware of one culture, one setting, one home; exiles [I interpret as people who have had to reconcile multiple cultural identities] are aware of at least two, and this plurality of vision gives rise to an awareness of simultaneous dimensions, an awareness that&mdash;to borrow a phrase from music&mdash;is contrapuntal. For an exile, habits of life, expression or activity in the new environment inevitably occur against the memory of these things in another environment. Thus both the new and the old  environments are vivid, actual, occurring together contrapuntally.

                        <h3>Peer Learning Facilitator (Academic Advancement Program)</h3>
                        <p>2021-22</p>
                        <p class="skills"> R &#8226; teaching</p>
                        <p>
                            Taught psychological stats and research methods! Out of many teaching opportunities at UCLA, I chose this program for its emphasis on accessible, non-intimidating learning, while supporting student populations that have been historically overlooked.  
                        </p>
                        <h3>Data Assistant (Los Angeles Education Research Institute)</h3>
                        <p>Summer 2021</p>
                        <p class="skills">STATA</p>
                        <p>
                            I learned Stata in one month here in order to wrangle the largest data set I've ever seen. This position also taught me the importance of communication, especially during remote work. Most of all, I was excited to apply my computer-science skills in a professional setting for the first time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We analyzed the impacts of COVID on LA students' lived experiences and academic outcomes. (You can probably guess what kind of results we got...)
                        </p>
                        <h3>Legislative Affairs Intern (California Department of Education)</h3>
                        <p>Spring 2021</p>
                        <p class="skills">Microsoft Excel &#8226; Microsoft Teams &#8226; policy research</p>
                        <p>
                            I applied for a cross-campus policy program basically on a whim, and I was so lucky to be able to learn so much about California governance and policy as a psychobiology major. I wrote policy briefings for the state superintendent of California himself!  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I had the chance here to research the history and current climate around affirmative action and American Indian studies (both very interesting stuff). Shoutout to Michelle for being the most supportive coworker I've ever had.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Research Assistant (Teaching and Learning Lab)</h3>

                        <p class="skills">Qualtrics &#8226; R</p>
                        <p>
                            This was my very first research experience. Shoutout to everyone here for being patient with me as I figured out the ropes of psychological research design and methods. I conducted an independent project on <a href="#projects">improving computer-science education</a> for marginalized populations based on my graduate student advisor's work. Check out the completed paper below.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also for this position I read an entire textbook on R over the summer ! This was the most self-learning I have ever done, and it has been incredibly helpful in my work.
                        </p>
                        <h3>UI/UX Designer (Depression Grand Challenge)</h3>

                            To think that I didn't know about Figma before this...Figma, the FREE (did I mention free??) alternative to Adobe that changed my life forever...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Got to work with a very supportive team on web design, infographics, and marketing materials for a mental-health screening and tracking service for undergraduate students! Had the chance to refine my design process and practice conducting usability focus sessions.
